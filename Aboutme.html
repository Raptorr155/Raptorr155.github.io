  <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #f5f5f5">About Me</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center; color: #f5f5f5"> Hi! <br><br>
My name is Jayden Irwin, I am a senior in high school and currently taking my second year in the Questar III Gaming and Multimedia program. I am a very creative person and am constantly working on developing my skills as a game designer, developer, and novelist. I have played many different types of games, all of which I take inspiration from in my own projects. My favorite games include RPGs like <i>Deltarune</i> and the <i>Pokemon</i> series, shooters like <i>Tom Clancy's: Rainbow Six Siege</i> and the <i>Splatoon</i> series, sandboxes like <i>Minecraft</i> and <i>Terraria</i>, and many, many more. (<i>Spirit of the North</i> 1 & 2, <i>Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon</i>, <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>  series, and <i>The Isle</i>, to name a few more games that I really enjoy.) I am also a regular listener to different types of music. At the moment, I am particularly interested in rap music from artists and groups like N.W.A., Dr. Dre, Eminem, Royce da 5”9, 50 Cent, JID, and others. I have a lot of other interests as well, such as world history and mythologies, dinosaurs and paleo research, as well as various movies, shows and animes. I really enjoy the writing aspect of my work, telling a story which can invoke different emotions in people is something I think is very powerful and important. I enjoy using symbolism within my writing, and learning about different types of symbolisms has made me learn more about myself as well. My favorite animal,  the fox, represents change in Japanese culture, and is something I strongly connect with.  
<br><br>
Ever since I was young I was interested in gaming. I started playing Nintendo games when I was seven after my dad introduced me to <i>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</i>. My other early gaming experiences were <i>Luigi’s Mansion 2</i> (<i>Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon</i> in the U.S. release) and The <i>Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds</i>. In 2022, with the release of <i>Splatoon 3</i>, I became very invested in the community for the game. As part of that community, I enjoyed talking with other fans about changes I would make to the game, and soon these ideas  developed into a passion for game design and balancing. That  combined with my love of writing, led me to enroll in the Questar III Gaming and Multimedia program, which I have used to strengthen my skills even more. 
I have worked on a few projects throughout my time in and out of the classroom,  including games like <i>Under The Strip</i>, a narrative puzzle game I made with some classmates for our final project our first year. That project taught me a lot about how to create ideas and work quickly as we only had about a month to make the game. It was also an introduction to a randomized level concept, as well as giving me more experience researching for and writing engaging story-driven content. 
<br><br>
Additionally, I solo developed a text-based adventure game  known as <i>I am a Cat</i>, which  hooked me on enhancing my skills in the emotional impact of story telling. Outside the classroom, however, I have been developing two other games  in my free time: <i>Operation: White Wave, and Lyra: Rebirth (+ Lyra: Afterlife)</i>. <i>Operation: White Wave</i> is a top down shooter game, which has been my favorite to work on  as it calls back to my time in the Splatoon community.  I have used the development of this game to increase my knowledge in game balancing, as well as learning the crucial importance of play testing and the overall player experience.  <i>Lyra: Rebirth</i> draws direct inspiration from <i>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</i>. The game serves as a tribute to my love for action adventure games as well as the feeling of exploration and discovery those games provide. The <i>Lyra: Rebirth</i> project is another instance of my developing skills in emotional story telling, as well as understanding the basics of what makes my favorite action adventure/RPG games good.
<br><br>
Looking ahead, my long term goals are to release my WIP games to the public, as well as release my WIP novels. However, some short term goals I have are getting a job/internship within the field, and advancing my technical skills to make my long term goals possible in the foreseeable future.
