  <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #3cdfff">About Me</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center; color: #3cdfff">Hi! My name is Jayden Irwin (He/They), I am a high school junior and an aspiring author and video game designer. I have been working on projects in these fields for about 6 years, with a lot of those projects still being developed. I am an active participant in online spaces like E-Sports and content creation as well. In my work, especially writing, I like to create awareness for serious problems and highlight the effects they have on people and the world around us. </p>
